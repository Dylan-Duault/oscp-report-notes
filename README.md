# oscp-report-notes
My repository for oscp notes taking and report template

I used [OSCP-Exam-Report-Template-Markdown ](https://github.com/noraj/OSCP-Exam-Report-Template-Markdown) and modify as it is in [OSCP report templates](https://help.offsec.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046787731-PEN-200-Reporting-Requirements).

I created a template for note taking for each Independent Challenges and Active Directory Set.

And maybe provide a cheatsheet to use with the exam.
